# Machine-Learning-Models-on-iPhone-Purchases-Dataset

In this project, I used Scikit-Learn to create a SVM model to classify iPhone purchase based on Age and Salary. i implemented n-fold cross validation and used it on an SVM model to see how it would affect the accuracy results. I also implemented a grid search on the c value and the tolerance value to see how it would affect the accuracy rate of the SVM model. At the end, I found that a c value of 0.60 and a tolerance value of 0.90 gave me the highest accuracy classification rate on SVM.
